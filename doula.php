When you are relying on your partner fully for support, it can sometimes be like asking them to coach the gold medal game of a sport they’ve never played or even seen before, where they don’t know the rules and can’t even speak the language!

And when it comes time to give birth, my husband is an expert on knowing "me," but not labor. My doula knows labor, but not the tiny ticks that make up me, so together they will bridge each other's gaps. And then she can also give him breaks leading up so he's not gassed out when I'm pushing and need him most.
