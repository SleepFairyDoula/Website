			<p class="section-article">Let me start off by saying labor & delivery does NOT have to be scary and can be an amazing experience. The thoughts you fix your mind on make a difference.
			So here we go
			April 15th at 5:30am I woke up to what I knew was my baby “dropping”, I literally heard his head hit my pelvis. I figured in the next day or two he would come. WELL ... 6:20am I had my first contraction.. and from that moment on they were 4 minutes apart. I didn’t mention it to Josh because I was told they’d start out random and far apart so he went to work. About an hour into 4 minute apart contractions I texted Josh and told him “We’re gonna have a baby today.. you need to come home”.
			I basically started out in active labor and ended up laboring at home for 3 hours. Midwives and doula told us it was time, so once Josh had the car packed, we headed to the hospital!
			I labored 3 hours at the hospital, moving all around (thankful for intermittent monitoring!!). Water broke about an hour or so in & I immediately felt the need to push but it was too soon (7cm). My Doula said I transitioned in the shower (OUCH).
			Once I was at 10cm, my eyes were closed the whole time haha.. I was in the zone. As I gripped his hand as hard as I could, I just heard Josh telling me to give it all I had... that I was so close. I honestly couldn’t have done it without his encouragement. He was and is the BEST husband and dad.
			I pushed for about 15-20 minutes and Joshua Samuel joined us at 12:21
			6 hours of labor naturally with no tearing, just like I prayed for OKAY GOD.
			That day goes down in the books for the most rewarding, joyful & exciting day of my life. I’m honestly still trying to find words for it. BUT the truth is, no matter what your story is, birthing your baby is to be celebrated and I hope you feel empowered to do ANYTHING.
			My hope in sharing this is that it encourages you pregnant mommas ... your body was made for this!</p>

			<p class="section-article">Around 7:30pm Eli arrived to take me home from the Blessing Way. We took a few photos then said our goodbyes. Once we got home, the surges picked up- inconsistent yes so I knew we should try to sleep. We did our regular bedtime routine and Sage was wiped from the day, so fell asleep quickly. I set up my birth altar in our living room just in case!
			From 10-11pm I timed my surges and they were flowing every 5-10 minutes. I texted Samantha at 11pm letting her know how I was doing and that we were going to try to sleep and that I’d let her know if anything changed. So we went to bed and they got stronger but I managed to go in and out of a dream state and woke up around 2am no longer being able to sleep or handle them on my own. I needed support.
			A few surges brought me to tears as I laid next to Eli. He said we should message Samantha and if anything, when she came over we could see if things were picking up or slowing. I got in the shower to get some relief on my back. Eli said he felt a bulge back there so I felt like she was moving down to make our way to us.
			Samantha came in and suggested we call the midwife. The surges were coming every 2-3 minutes at this point. We started to prep the birth space and the pool took forever to blow up. We only had so much hot water in the tank so knew it would take some time to fill. Samantha supported me through some intense surges and we kept trying to get ahold of Gladys, the midwife.
			I told Sam I was pretty tired since I wasn’t getting much of a break between surges, but I was mentally preparing for another day of labor. There’s no way I was dilated yet, I had no bloody show and my water hadn’t broken yet which is why I was apprehensive about how far along in labor I truly was. I felt like I just started active labor at 2am.
			Samantha and Eli continued to prep, filling up the birth tub with warm water from the stove and hot water pitcher. Things started to get intense and I wanted to get in the pool so bad. I told Sam, I hope the water slows things down to give me a break before moving into transition.</p>
